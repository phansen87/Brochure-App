# Brochure-App
brochure app that is a work in progress

The code listed here is missing the UI elements. The app works by clicking an item that represents the Brochure name,
then loading up a full screen brochure that can be zoomed and moved around the screen by touch using the 
TouchImageView from https://github.com/MikeOrtiz/TouchImageView.
